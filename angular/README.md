# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

###

Angular makes heavy use of classes - a feature that's supported by vanilla JavaScript and TypeScript (though TypeScript "extends" it and adds some extra features as you'll see).

A class is essentially a blueprint for objects. Any properties and methods defined in the class will exist on all objects that are created based on the class.

For example, if you had this class (in vanilla JavaScript):

class Person {
constructor(name, age) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
}

greet() {
console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
}
}
You could instantiate it (and create objects) like this:

const person1 = new Person('Max', 35);
const person2 = new Person('Anna', 32);
And you could then access the properties and methods defined by the class:

console.log(person1.age);
person2.greet();
When using Angular, you'll often define classes which are NEVER

## Attribute Binding

In the previous lecture, you were introduced to "Property Binding" - a key Angular feature that allows you to bind element properties to dynamic values.

For example, <img [src]="someSrc"> binds the src property of the underlying HTMLImageElement DOM object to the value stored in someSrc.

Whilst it might look like you're binding the src attribute of the <img> tag, you're actually NOT doing that. Instead, property binding really targets the underlying DOM object property (in this case a property that's also called src) and binds that.

This might look like a subtle detail (and often it indeed doesn't matter) but it's important to understand this difference between element attributes and property. This article can help with understanding this difference.

Whilst it won't make a difference in Angular apps in many cases, it DOES matter if you're trying to set attributes on elements dynamically. Attributes which don't have an equally-named underlying property.

For example, when binding ARIA attributes, you can't target an underlying DOM object property.

Since "Property Binding" wants to target properties (and not attributes), that can be a problem. That's why Angular offers a slight variation of the "Property Binding" syntax that does allow
